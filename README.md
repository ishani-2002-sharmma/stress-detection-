User-generated content related to stress, anxiety, and depression has become increasingly
prevalent on the many social media platforms of the digital age. This project uses a dataset
taken from Reddit discussions to identify textual data that expresses attitudes connected to
stress. Using preprocessing methods and a Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm, the objective is to
identify stress-related patterns in these posts. This investigation demonstrates how machine
learning can be used to interpret and identify mental health issues in online narratives.
